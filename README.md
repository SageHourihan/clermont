## Current Status

Clermont is currently in active development, with core tracking functionality implemented for the Port of Detroit region. The platform successfully integrates real-time AIS data with weather information to provide a comprehensive maritime awareness solution.

### Current Coverage

- Port of Detroit
- Detroit River
- Surrounding Great Lakes waters

## Features

### Real-Time Tracking

- Live vessel position monitoring using AIS data
- Interactive map interface with custom ship markers
- Continuous data updates via WebSocket connection

### Weather Integration

- Real-time temperature readings
- Wind speed and direction data
- Dynamic weather updates based on map position

### Technical Implementation

- WebSocket integration for real-time data streaming
- MongoDB for efficient data storage
- Memcached for optimized performance
- Mobile-responsive design

## System Architecture

Clermont employs a modern LAMP stack architecture with additional technologies for real-time capabilities:

- Backend: PHP with MongoDB and MySQL
- Frontend: JavaScript with Leaflet.js
- Real-time: WebSocket connections
- Caching: Memcached
- APIs: AISStream, OpenWeather

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd clermont
    ```

2.  **Install Composer dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**

    -   Create a new MySQL database.
    -   Import the provided database schema (if available) or create the necessary tables.
    -   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with your database credentials and other environment variables. Example:

        ```
        DB_HOST=your_database_host
        DB_NAME=your_database_name
        DB_USER=your_database_user
        DB_PASS=your_database_password
        ```

4.  **Configure constants:**

    -   Ensure the `config/constants.php` file correctly defines the `PROJECT_ROOT` constant.

5.  **Configure database connection:**

    -   The `config/db.php` file uses the `Dotenv` library to load environment variables from the `.env` file. Make sure your database credentials are correctly set in the `.env` file.

6.  **Set up web server:**

    -   Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to point the document root to the `public` directory.
    -   Ensure that the web server has write permissions to the necessary directories (e.g., for logs or uploaded files, if any).

7.  **Access the application:**

    -   Open your web browser and navigate to the project's URL.

## Usage Guide

-   **Real-time tracking:** The `index.php` page displays the real-time location of active ships on a map.
-   **Historical route:** The `historical_route.php` page displays the historical route of a selected vessel. You can access this page by clicking on a vessel on the map and then clicking the "Get Route" button.
-   **About:** The `about.php` page provides information about the Clermont Tracker project.
-   **Contact:** The contact form is located at the contact button in the nav bar.

### Weather Information

- Weather data updates as you move your mouse across the map
- Temperature displayed in Fahrenheit
- Wind speed shown in miles per hour
- Wind direction indicated in degrees
